## Selenium

To run your test you must have selenium server up and running to execute any webdriverIO tests, or it will fail fast with an error. To start selenium automatically it has been added as part of services: ['selenium-standalone'] in the wdio.conf.js. That's all there is to it.!.

## Config Files

WebdriverIO uses configuration files to setup and execute tests in specific ways. The configuration is fully customizable, and different functions can be invoked before, during and after each test or test suite. Config files can be found in the /webdriverio-test/ directory and name wdio.conf.js. This can be called via the the cli.
